<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item"> Antetokounmpo is averaging 25 points, 14.2 rebounds (fourth-most in the NBA), 5.7 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.
  Because he's been the best player on the top team in the NBA so far, Antetokounmpo is easily the top choice to win the 
  MVP Award right now. Taking note of his dominant trajectory over the last few years, 
  it feels like the stars are aligning for Giannis and the Bucks to close the gap on the rest of the conference.
  He will surely put together another compelling statistical argument, after averaging nearly 26.9 points, 10.0 rebounds,
  4.8 assists and more than a block and a steal per game last season. His size and athletic gifts point to untapped
  ceiling. </div>
