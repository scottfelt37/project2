<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">The versatility of Durant to defend any player on the court at any given time at a 
high and effective level makes him more valuable than Curry.After finishing seventh in 
the ballots last season, it appears that other players are more focused or are in a better
position to achieving MVP honors more than Durant is. While he is more than capable of 
putting up numbers to get him some further consideration, it simply isn’t necessary given 
the Warriors mentality of team first basketball. He has his MVP trophy and could just be 
content with being a solo winner of the award. After all, Kobe Bryant only has one MVP trophy
 and it’s safe to say he will go down as one of the greatest to play the game. When all is said 
 and done, Durant just might very well be in that same conversation as his career continues in that direction.   </div>
