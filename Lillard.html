  <div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">When looking at exactly why Lillard may be underrated, it is easy to point the finger at the franchise straight 
  away and say playing for a small market franchise limits your accessibility to a wider fan base. This is true 
  to some extent, as being in a small market like Portland doesnâ€™t help. But with individual highlights, statistics
  and social media accounts under the microscope more than ever, what is it going to take for someone averaging 24.7 
  points, 5.2 rebounds and 6 assists per game to be recognized as a top 10 player in the league? Had he played like this 
  under the glitz and glamor of L.A. or New York there is no doubt he would have finished in the Top 5 for MVP votes for
  the last few years, regardless of whether or not Portland finished top of the standings.</div>
