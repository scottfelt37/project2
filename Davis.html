  <div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">  Not only is he a great all-around player, but he’s one of the more refined big men in the league.
  A talented shot-blocker, rebounder, shooter and ball-handler, Davis can do it all. He averaged 28.1 points per game 
  last season while also increasing his block, steal, assist and field goal percentage totals.
  Anthony Davis is improving each season; now he’s got the burden of winning a playoff game (and series) off his chest.
  He placed third in both the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year voting last season. Expectations will be sky high 
  but his confidence is through the roof.Davis put up MVP numbers at the end of last season and if he rides the momentum 
  into next season, he could feasibly average over 30 points and 10-plus rebounds per contest.</div>
