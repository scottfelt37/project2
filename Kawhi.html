  <div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">  Leonard is off to a monstrous start with Toronto, shattering 
  that pesky myth that he was a product of a system in San Antonio.
  Anyone who forgot just how devastating a two-way player he could be
  after his nine-game run with the Spurs last season should have a clearer 
  understanding of what he can do when healthy. Just ask Philadelphia 76ers
  stud Ben Simmons, who couldn't praise Leonard enough after matching wits 
  with the two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year. “He’s a freak,” Simmons
  said after turning the ball over 11 times while being guarded by Leonard on 
  Tuesday. “His hands are huge. He’s got long arms. He’s a great defender.” 
  The scary part for the rest of the league? Leonard is shooting as good or better
  than ever on 3-pointers (44.4 percent) while logging a career-high 34.7 minutes. </div>
